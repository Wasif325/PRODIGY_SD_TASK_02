Number Guessing Game This programming task has been assigned by Prodigy Infotech as part of the software development internship.

Description The Number Guessing Game is a Python program that offers an engaging challenge to users. It generates a random number and invites the user to guess it. The program's interactive interface prompts the user to input their guess. After each guess, the program provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user accurately guesses the number, at which point the program displays the number of attempts it took to win the game.

Features Generates a random number for the user to guess. User-friendly interface with input prompts. Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. Displays the number of attempts it took to win the game. Encourages interactive and engaging gameplay. How to Play Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone. Navigate to the project directory. Run the program using a Python interpreter: python number_guessing_game.py. Follow the prompts to input your guesses and receive feedback. The game will continue until you accurately guess the random number. Once guessed correctly, the program will display the number of attempts it took to win the game. Example Suppose the random number to guess is 47:

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! Guess a number between 1 and 100: 50 Too high! Try again. Guess a number between 1 and 100: 30 Too low! Try again. Guess a number between 1 and 100: 47 Congratulations! You guessed the number 47 correctly in 3 attempts.
